## Lesson Metadata

3. Proposed Lesson Title: How to upload Vids to Youtube

4. Lesson Abstract (3-4 sentences): The primary purpose of writing this current tutorial is to learn how to quickly and efficiently learn to upload a video to youtube. I will also cover how to add tags and how to make the videos private\public\unlisted.

5. A short description of the situation/need that your lesson responds to (consider details of purpose, audience, context): I have had several classes that allowed videos and clips to be used as a means to complete projects but many students struggled with how to bring their finished project to the school in a economical or efficient manner. I would go as far to say some would bring a video on a piece of hardware to only find out that it was corrupt and having the video uploaded as a fall back would have saved them heart ache.

6. Learning Outcomes of Tutorial (between 2-3): Student audiences will be able to upload video fotage to youtube in a quick efficient manner. The Student audeince will also be able to navigate the privacy options for their uploads.
