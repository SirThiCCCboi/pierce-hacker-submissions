## Lesson Metadata

3. Proposed Lesson Title: Notability on Ipad
4. Lesson Abstract (3-4 sentences): Notability is a powerful app to make note in class or meeting. 

Students are sometimes asked to work in genres other than academic essays and in media other than print documents. One example of this kind work includes making podcasts. The purpose of this lesson is to help students get started using Audacity for projects -- like podcasts -- that require audio editing. This lesson will cover installing Audacity on a personal computer, setting up an initial project, basic audio editing tools and workflow, and exporting projects as an audio file.

5. A short description of the situation/need that your lesson responds to (consider details of purpose, audience, context):

This tutorial responds to a couple of scenarios. In my English 101 classes, I sometimes ask students to make podcasts. This tutorial is meant to support them. Additionally, I want to encourage other faculty to have their students experiment with genres like podcasts. This should also be a resource that can support their work.

6. Learning Outcomes of Tutorial (between 2-3):

After completing this tutorial students:

* will be able to create a new project in Audacity.
* will be able to make basic edits to audio files within an Audacity project.
* will be able to export a finished audio project and share it via an audio file.

7. Course most relevant to your tutorial (if any): English 101 or any course that asks students to compose with sound.

8. Discipline/Research Area most relevant to your tutorial? Example - Humanities / Social Sciences / Mathematics / Natural Sciences / Physical Sciences / Business-Pro-Tech / other

This tutorial is relevant to multiple disciplines.

9. Intended Submission Date:

I'll have an initial draft of this complete by Friday, Jan. 31. Final version by Feb. 5

10. Lesson will use open technology and data at no cost to the reader?

Yes. Audacity is free software.

11. Any other comments for the editor?

Not at this point.
