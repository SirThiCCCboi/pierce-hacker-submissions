# Using your Outlook Calendar to Manage a Busy Schedule

### As a student, your schedule can get pretty hectic. Keeping track of classes, appointments, due dates, and personal obligations can be challenging. This tutorials will show you how to how to effectively schedule standalone and recurring events in Microsoft Outlook. It will also include ideas on how to use the calendar feature to collaborate with peers and teachers. 

### Learning Outcomes
After viewing this tutorial, students should be able to:
* Schedule recurring events on their calendar
*	Invite peers to meetings or events
*	Set up reminder notifications for scheduled events (due dates, etc.)






## Getting Started

You have several options on how much of your calendar you can view at one time. You can choose to view your schedule one day at a time, the work week (Monday-Friday), the full week (Sunday-Saturday), the entire month, or schedule view (which is one day, organized hourly, but with a different setup than the day option). You can decide which layout makes the most sense to you. For me, viewing the entire month often makes the most sense to me, so we will start there.

## Adding an Event

Let's begin by adding events to your calendar. To do this, you will want to double-click on the day you would like to add the task or event to. (If you prefer starting at the daily or weekly view, you have the option of double-clicking the specific time the event will start.)

When the Untitled-Event screen is open, you'll want to give the event a title and possibly type in specific details into the big open space.

Next, you will want to adjust the start time and end time to reflect whent the event will begin and how long it will be. You can also adjust the start date and end date if the event is longer than a day. To do this, click on the little arrow next to what you would like to alter. This will bring up a drop down box full of options to choose from.

_*Note:* you cannot change the time if the All Day box is checked._

If it is helpful, you can enter the location that the event will take place. You can enter a specific address like '9401 Farwest Dr SW, Lakewood, WA 98498' or type in a more general location such as 'Puyallup campus' or 'Mom's house'.

To organize events into different categories, use the colorful box icon to color-code. For example, you can use green for science class, blue for math class, orange for your job, and purple for personal tasks.

## Setting Reminders

On the top of the page, there is a bell icon that allows you to set a reminder of the event. Using the dropdown arrow, you can select to be notified minutes, hours, or days before the event will start. For example, setting a one day notification on your 'Recycling Day' event will give you a reminder to take the recycle bin to the curb the day before it gets picked up.

## Recurring Events

Having events repeat can be very useful for tasks such as classes that you have three times a week or taking your recycle bin out every two weeks. For tasks that need to be done daily at a certain time, like taking a medication, you can also set your event to Make Recurring. Use the Make Recurring button within the event and customize the frequency, days, and time as needed.

## Private Events

There is an option to make an event private, to ensure that you are the only one who can see the information. Use the three dots icon at the top of the page and click Private (with the lock next to it). 

_*Note:* Only those who you share your calendar with have access to the information on your calendar_

## Saving Your Event

You can customize an event with as much or as little information to make it helpful for you. When you have put the finishing touches on your event, be sure to hit the Save & Close button on the top left of the screen. This will put the event directly into your calendar. You can edit saved events by double clicking on it, updating the information, and saving it again. You can also move an event from one day to the next by dragging and dropping.

## Collaborating with Other People

Another very useful feature of the Outlook calendar is inviting peers or professors to a meeting or event, such as a study session. To do this, use the icon at the top of the page that looks like a person with a plus and minus sign. Using this gives you the option to invite anyone in your contacts to your event. Just type the persons name or email address into either the Required or Optional fields. When you have finished creating the event and adding a person, click Send. The invited person (or people) will then receive your invitation and can choose to accept or decline it. If they accept, the event will automatically show up on their calendar as well. Outlook will let you know via email whether the invited person has accepted, declined, or has suggested a different time that would work better for them.

### I use Outlook on my school laptop, work computer, and mobile device to always have access to my calendar. For me personally, scheduling my classes, due dates, work hours, tasks, and recreational plans, helps me stay organized and improves my time management skills. I hope this tutorial will help you as well.
