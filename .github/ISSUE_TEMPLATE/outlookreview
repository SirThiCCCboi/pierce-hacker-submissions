## Audience
I believe the target Audience is very clear and there isnt any confusion as to whom the guide is helpful for.

## Getting Ready

Although you dont have a list of what is needed, I feel like its self explanitory what is needed just by the title of the guide. You need access to outlook.

## Skimmability
I know youll be adding screen shots so I will skip any critic on that. Your titles are very clear and easy to spot, making navigating the guide easy.

## Payoff
I feel like the pay off is definately. Its easy to understand and how to apply the knowledge they are beign given. If i were to nit pick i would say add some examples of why some of those things are usefull within each section.( I know at the end you put a personal touch on how it has helped you)

## Workflow


## Further reading/additional resources

Maybe have a small part tell the audience if you dont have access to out look go **here**.

## Final Thoughts and Recommendations

Think its looking good and hope to see the next draft soon.
