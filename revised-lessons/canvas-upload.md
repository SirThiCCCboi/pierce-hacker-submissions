## Lesson Abstract

Canvas is the program that students at Pierce College use to view/submit assignments, interact with classmates in discussion posts, and  see grades and other course-related information . Canvas is available via web browser and mobile app. This tutorial will show step-by-step instructions on how to submit an assignment on the Canvas mobile app. 



## Lesson Objectives

* Uploading files to Canvas storage
* Submitting assignments via file upload
* Submitting assignments via text entry box



## Materials

- Smartphone
- Internet access
- Canvas app






### Uploading Files into File Storage Folder

There is a file storage area in the Canvas app that acts as a hub for you to use to turn in files from. This will explain how to upload files from your phone to this area so that you can then turn them in to your classes. Any assignment submitted will also be stored in this folder, so you have access to view older assignments.



Tap the menu icon to see options. The menu icon is represented by three horizontal lines.

</p>



The menu shows your profile information, your file folder, bookmarks, and a few options to change settings.


Tap the first folder, labelled Files.

</p>

Now that you are in the Files storage you can upload files to it. First, select the plus sign in the bottom right hand corner by tapping it once with your finger.

This will bring up two options. The first is a file folder icon; selecting this will create a new folder to help with organization. The second icon looks like an arrow pointing upwards. This is the "upload" option and will allow us to search for the file we want to upload to the Files storage area.



Tapping the upload icon will give three options to choose a file from; Camera, Gallery, and Device.

* Camera opens your device's camera feature so you can take a picture.
* Gallery allows you to select one or more pictures already on your device.
* Device allows you to select a file from your device or Drive storage.

At this point you can select the option that best works for you.



## Submitting Assignments via File Upload

Depending on your professor's organizational style, assignments can typically be found in a course's Module section or Assignment section. 

Be sure to always check the rubric before submitting your assignment to understand exactly what is expected.

When you have completed the assignment, hit the Submit Assignment button within the assignment.

Select File Upload.

Select either the Camera, Gallery, or Device option.

Select the desired picture or file.

Hit Submit to turn in the assignment.



## Submitting Assignments via Text Entry

Certain assignments require you to type something into a text entry box instead of uploading a separate file.

Be sure to always check the rubric before submitting your assignment to understand exactly what is expected. 

To submit assignments like this, hit the Submit Assignment button within the assignment.

Select Text Entry.

Type in the necessary information. Be sure to use correct spelling and grammar, and take advantage of the various formatting options available.

Hit Submit to turn in the assignment.



That's it! Now you are ready to submit your assignments on Canvas mobile!
